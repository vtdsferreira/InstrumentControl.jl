Object representing a "sweep job." While a `Sweep` object has all information
related to the actual measurement, we would like to have some metadata associated
with each `Sweep` oject for the purposes of queueing multiple different sweeps,
automatic scheduling of sweeps in a queue, logging of information, etc. For this
purpose, we create a `SweepJob` type to hold together the sweep and all metadata
associated with it.

A `SweepJob` object holds a [`InstrumentControl.Sweep`](@ref)  `sweep` object.
`priority` is an `Int` from 0 to `typemax(Int)`, inclusive, and is used to
prioritize the next sweep in a queue (with multiple sweeps) to be run. It is
typically one of the following:

- `HIGH == 10`
- `NORMAL == 5`
- `LOW == 0`

`job_id` is used as the reference to the sweep job in the ICDataServer, and in the
jobs queue. When a new sweep is requested, and the corresponding `SweepJob` object
is made, an appropriate job_id is requested from the ICDataServer and is automatically
assigned to the job object. The job is then automatically submitted to the
queue with this `job_id` as it's identifier and handle.

`status` is a channel that holds the status of a job (Waiting,Running,Aborted,Done),
and is used for interstask communcations for operations on jobs such as starting
the job, aborting the job, queueing the job, etc, as well communication with
ICDataServer. For example: a change in status of a job to "Done" or "Aborted"
prompts the job status to be updated in the ICDataServer; or, once a queued sweep is
next in line to be run, the queue changes the sweep job's status from "Waiting"
to "Running", which then automatically prompts the queued sweep to be started.

`progress` is a channel to track the progress of a sweep job; the progress is
calculated as a sweep is run, and the number is put into this channel. The rest
of the fields are metadata for logging purposes: `whensub` is when the `Sweep`
was created, `whenstart` is when the `Sweep` was initially run, `username` is who
submitted the sweep job. If `notifications` is true, status updates are sent out
if possible. These metadata are logged in the database set up by ICDataServer with
which InstrumentControl interacts with

A queue responsible for prioritizing sweeps and executing them accordingly. The
queue holds `SweepJob` objects, and "indexes" them by their `job_id`. It prioritizes
jobs based on their priorities; for equal priority values, the job submitted earlier
takes precedent. The queue keeps track of which job is running (if any) by its
`running_id` `Channel`. The queue keeps track of the last finished job by the
`last_finished_id` channel, for easy access to the data of the last finished job.
Other fields are used for intertask communication. Note that a `running_id of` -1
signifies that no job is running.

When a `SweepJobQueue` is created through it's argumentless inner constructor (made
for initialization purposes), two tasks are initialized. One task manages
job updates, the other task is responsible for starting jobs; the former task
executes the `job_updater` function, the latter task executes the `job_starter`
function. Both functions execute infinite while loops, therefore they never end.

When the job starter task is notified with the `trystart::Condition` object in
the `SweepJobQueue` object, it will find the highest priority job in the queue.
Then, if a job is not running, and the prioritized job is waiting,
and if the prioritized job is runnable (the priority may be "NEVER"), then the
job is started. The database is updated asynchronously to reflect the new job,
the queue's `running_id` is changed to the job's id, and the job's status is
changed to "Running".

The job updater task tries to take a `SweepJob` from `update_channel`, the unbuffered
job `Channel` of the `SweepJobQueue` object. The task is blocked until a job is
put into the channel. Once a job arrives, provided the job has finished or has
been aborted, the database is asynchronously updated, the job is marked as no longer
running (by updating the `running_id` and `last_finished_id` channels), the sweep result
is asynchronously saved to disk, and finally the job starter task is notified
through the queue's `trystart` `Condition` object. The job updater task loops around
and waits for another job to arrive at its channel.

`sweep` measures a response as a function of an arbitrary number of stimuli,
sourced over the values given in the `AbstractVector` input, and returns
a handle to the sweep job. This can be used to access the results while the
sweep is being measured.

This function is responsible for 1) initialzing sockets for communication with the
ICDataServer, 2) initializing an appropriate array to hold the reults of the sweep,
3) preparing a [`InstrumentControl.SweepJob`](@ref) object with an appropriate `job_id`
obtained from the database, 4) adding the job to the default `SweepJobQueue` object
(defined when the InstrumentControl module is used/imported), and 5) launching an
asynchronous sweep job.

The `priority` keyword may be `LOW`, `NORMAL`, or `HIGH`, or any
integer greater than or equal to zero.

The actual sweeping, i.e., the actual `source` and `measure`
loops to measure data are in a private function [`InstrumentControl._sweep!`](@ref).
Note that if [`InstrumentControl._sweep!`](@ref) is not defined yet, this function will
also define the method in order to it to be used to schedule a sweep.

```
_sweep!(::Val{D}, ::Val{N}, sj, update_channel)
```

This is a private function which should not be called directly by the user.
It is launched asynchronously by [`sweep`](@ref). The implementation uses macros from
[Base.Cartesian](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/devdocs/cartesian/).
The stimuli are sourced only when they need to be, at the start of each `for` loop level.

`D` is the dimension of the output array of the measure function (if multiple
things are measured for one Response type, the array will be multi-dimensional).
`N` is the number of stimuli which the sweep sources over. sj is the handle to
the `SweepJob` object, and update_channel is a channel of the queue used for
intertask comunication.

The axis scaling of `measure(sj.sweep.dep)`, i.e., the dimensions of the output
array of the function. is presumed to be fixed, as it is only looked at once,
the first time `measure` is called.

```
@respond_to_status
```
Respond to status changes during a sweep. This is the entry point for sweeps to
be paused or aborted. When a sweep is scheduled, this macro has to end before
the sweep actually starts sourcing the instruments and performing measurements
through the [`InstrumentControl._sweep!`](@ref) function. The macro only ends
when the status of the job changes from "Waiting" to something else.

If the status is changed to "Aborted", the macro executes "return". In practice,
since this macro is called by the [`InstrumentControl._sweep!`](@ref) function,
this causes the [`InstrumentControl._sweep!`](@ref) function to abort as well,
thus stopping the sweep.

Not meant to be called by the user. It will break if
argument names of [`InstrumentControl._sweep!`](@ref) are modified.
